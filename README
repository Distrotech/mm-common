The mm-common module provides the build infrastructure and utilities
shared among the GNOME C++ binding libraries.  It is only a required
dependency for building the C++ bindings from the version control
repository.  It is not required for building tarball releases.

This module is part of the GNOME C++ bindings effort <http://www.gtkmm.org/>.
