mm-common 0.7.4 "Example" (2009-09-15)

	Id est exempli gratia.

	* The skeleton source tree now includes an examples/ directory
	  a skeletonmm.h single-include header file.
	* The skeleton Doxygen configuration file has been corrected
	  and updated for Doxygen 1.6.1.
	* The doc-install.pl utility no longer splits glob patterns
	  with embedded whitespace into multiple patterns.

mm-common 0.7.3 "Skeleton" (2009-09-09)

	The hip bone is connected to the rib bone.

	* A skeleton source tree of a C++ binding based on mm-common
	  is now provided as a starting point for new binding modules.
	* The mm-common-prepare utility now comes with a manual page.
	* Empty documentation groups are no longer shown as chapters
	  in the Devhelp document.
	* The reference documentation will be rebuilt when any of the
	  configuration header files of a module changed.
	* The Doxygen style sheet has been further refined.

mm-common 0.7.2 "Help" (2009-09-02)

	Get better help from Devhelp with an improved transformation.

	* The transformation from Doxygen to Devhelp no longer treats
	  documentation groups as C++ namespaces.  Also, documentation
	  modules are now listed as book chapters.
	* The shared Doxygen style sheet has been adjusted to work
	  properly with the new XHTML output of Doxygen.

mm-common 0.7.1 "Lenience" (2009-08-28)

	Be a bit less unfashionably draconian.

	* It is no longer a hard error to build a package based on
	  mm-common on a system with an older installation of glibmm
	  which lacks the shared documentation utilities.

mm-common 0.7 "Stylish" (2009-08-28)

	Document with style, using the new shared Doxygen style sheet.

	* A common style sheet for the C++ bindings documentation has
	  been added, in order to improve and unify the appearance of
	  the generated reference documentation.

mm-common 0.6.1 "Librarian" (2009-08-25)

	We're on library.gnome.org now, yay!

	* The only change in this release is the new default location
	  of the public reference documentation, which is now hosted
	  on library.gnome.org.

mm-common 0.6 "Slash" (2009-08-24)

	To slash or not to slash? This release is all about slashes.

	* The external documentation magic now pleases both Doxygen
	  and doc-install.pl: no more double slashes or accidentally
	  concatenated words.
	* Absolute local paths are converted to file:// URIs for the
	  XML and HTML documentation output.
	* The documentation generation is disabled automatically if the
	  utilities required to build it are missing at configure time.
	* Add checks for GNU make and Perl.

mm-common 0.5 "RTFM!" (2009-08-17)

	First tarball release of mm-common, the shiny new shared
	build infrastructure of the GNOME C++ binding modules.
