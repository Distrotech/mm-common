mm-common 0.7 "Stylish" (2009-08-28)

	Document with style, using the new shared Doxygen style sheet.

	* A common style sheet for the C++ bindings documentation has
	  been added, in order to improve and unify the appearance of
	  the generated reference documentation.

mm-common 0.6.1 "Librarian" (2009-08-25)

	We're on library.gnome.org now, yay!

	* The only change in this release is the new default location
	  of the public reference documentation, which is now hosted
	  on library.gnome.org.

mm-common 0.6 "Slash" (2009-08-24)

	To slash or not to slash? This release is all about slashes.

	* The external documentation magic now pleases both Doxygen
	  and doc-install.pl: no more double slashes or accidentally
	  concatenated words.
	* Absolute local paths are converted to file:// URIs for the
	  XML and HTML documentation output.
	* The documentation generation is disabled automatically if the
	  utilities required to build it are missing at configure time.
	* Add checks for GNU make and Perl.

mm-common 0.5 "RTFM!" (2009-08-17)

	First tarball release of mm-common, the shiny new shared
	build infrastructure of the GNOME C++ binding modules.
