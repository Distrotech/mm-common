mm-common 0.6 "Slash" (2009-08-20)

	To slash or not to slash? This release is all about slashes.

	* The external documentation magic now pleases both Doxygen
	  and doc-install.pl: no more double slashes or accidentally
	  concatenated words.
	* Absolute local paths are converted to file:// URIs for the
	  XML and HTML documentation output.
	* The documentation generation is disabled automatically if the
	  utilities required to build it are missing at configure time.

mm-common 0.5 "RTFM!" (2009-08-17)

	First tarball release of mm-common, the shiny new shared
	build infrastructure of the GNOME C++ binding modules.
